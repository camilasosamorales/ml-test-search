Wellcome to my front-end Mercadolibre challenge solution. I'll explain how to run my react app. 

## Installing

After cloning the repo https://github.com/camilasosamorales/ml-test-search.git, you should go to the folder and run

### `npm install                                                                                                  `

It will install all the recuried dependencies.

## Running
Once all the dependencies are installed, run the app

### `npm start                                                                                                  `

It will launch the app on http://localhost:3000
